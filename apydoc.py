# The -m option in Python allows you to run a module as a script. 
# This means that you can use the module name to run the code contained within it as 
# if you were executing a script with the same name. For example, if you have a module named example_module.py, 
# you can run it as a script using the command python -m example_module. This is equivalent to running python example_module.py. 
# The -m option is useful for testing modules, or for running code that's contained in a module without having to write a separate script.
